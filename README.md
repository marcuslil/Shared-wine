# Shared-wine

This piece of code tested for ubuntu 14.04 will create a shared wine folder /sharedwine. When wine programs are installed there they wil use the windows program files from this folder, while using the profile files from a folder in our home drive. This enables usage of a shared wine environment while user config files are kept private.
